          <p>
            Our Cluster Home investments are designed to provide stable,
            diversified exposure to residential real estate without the
            operational burden of managing individual properties. Each cluster
            includes a small group of newly constructed homes in the same
            neighborhoodâ€”professionally leased, maintained, and overseen by our
            on-the-ground property management team.
          </p>
          <p>
            By pooling several homes together, investors benefit from shared
            costs, consistent maintenance standards, and reliable cash flow
            performance across multiple units. Returns are generated through a
            mix of quarterly rental distributions and long-term appreciation
            once the properties are stabilized and sold.
          </p>
          <p className="muted">
            In short, the Cluster model combines the steady income potential of
            rental housing with the scalability and convenience of a managed
            investment structure.
